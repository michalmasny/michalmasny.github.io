    <p class="paragraph_style_4"> My research program is centred around a belief in the normative significance of the passage of time. Our lives are situated between the past and the future, extended in time, and constrained by time, and my work aims to advance our philosophical understanding of the ways in which these features affect what is valuable and what we have reasons to do. Much of this research lies within four areas of ethics: preserving the valuable, well-being, the future of humanity, and the ethics of technology. But I also maintain side interests and have published articles in epistemology and the history of philosophy.</p>

<p class="paragraph_style_3">Dissertation: "Preserving the Valuable"</p>
                
<p class="paragraph_style_4">Many people believe that we have a distinctive moral reason to preserve certain non-instrumentally valuable things -- such as beautiful paintings, important traditions, and loving relationships -- even when a superior replacement is available. G. A. Cohen (2012) dubbed this view 'conservatism about value'. <br><br>My dissertation offers a systematic discussion of this position, traversing normative ethics, metaethics, and bioethics. On the theoretical side, I examine what explains the presence of conservative reasons, how strong these reasons are, which things we have reasons to conserve, and who these reasons apply to. On the practical side, I argue that this view illuminates old and new puzzles about the shape of a life, the significance of progress, how to navigate different stages of life, how long we should wait before moving on from a loss, and the emerging technologies of life extension.

<blockquote class="paragraph_style_4"><i>Abstract</i>: Schopenhauer's argument against suicide has served as a punching bag for many modern-day commentators. Dale Jacquette, Sandra Shapshay, and David Hamlyn all argue that the premises of this argument or its conclusion are inconsistent with Schopenhauer's wider metaphysical and ethical project. This paper defends Schopenhauer from these charges. Along the way, it examines the relations between suicide, death by voluntary starvation, negation of the will, compassion, and Schopenhauer's critiques of cynicism and stoicism.</blockquote>

Others believe in decline: they argue that the human condition has deteriorated and will continue to do so. What has been neglected, however, is a purely normative question of whether it is better if the history of humanity displays a pattern of improvement rather than deterioration, other things equal. Many people have the intuition that it is. This paper offers a theoretical rationale for this judgment which appeals to a broadly conservative view about value and explores the implications of this view for matters related to the future of humanity.</p>

The first part examines the ground, scope, content, and strength of our reasons to conserve. The second part shows that this view can elucidate a number of puzzling issues, such as how to balance exploration and commitment at different stages of life, whether the reluctance to start new projects and relationships in old age is justified, why we sometimes shouldn’t extend our life, when it is permissible to move on from a loss, and why an improving life seems better than a deteriorating one. </p>

This paper offers a novel argument in favour of developing such technology and making it unconditionally available to everyone. In particular, it argues that justice requires that each person be provided with sufficient opportunities to have a ‘complete life’, that many people currently lack such opportunities, and that we would substantially improve the status quo by giving them access to anti-ageing technology.</p>

<p class="paragraph_style_4"><i>Abstract</i>: Epistemic consequentialism has been challenged on the grounds that it is overly demanding. According to the Epistemic Junk Problem, this view implies that we are often required to believe junk propositions such as ‘the Great Bear Lake is the largest lake entirely in Canada’ and long disjunctions of things we already believe. According to the Numerosity Problem, this view implies that we are frequently required to have an enormous number of beliefs. This paper puts forward a novel version of epistemic consequentialism which avoids these twin demandingness problems. The key is to recognise, first, that the final epistemic value of a true belief depends at least in part on the duration for which it is retained by the agent and, second, that our cognitive make-up places important constraints on which beliefs are retained and for how long.</p>
